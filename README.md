# Designs
For as long as I can remember, I have always found enjoyment and reward in creating, building and improving stuff.  By stuff, I mean pretty much anything that is used for any purpose: devices, tools, toys, software, processes, etc. I welcome any opportunity to examine existing products to find innovations and improvements, as much as inventing a new product.

This page presents a collection of ideas, designs and innovations I have come up with in the past 10 or so years.  They cover user interfaces, sporting equipment and assistive products.
