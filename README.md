# Designs
For as long as I can remember, I have always found enjoyment and reward in creating, building and improving stuff.  By stuff, I mean pretty much anything that is used for any purpose: devices, tools, toys, software, processes, etc. I welcome any opportunity to examine existing products to find innovations and improvements, as much as inventing a new product.

This page presents a collection of ideas, designs and innovations I have come up with in the past 10 or so years.  They cover user interfaces, sporting equipment and assistive products.

## Children's Virtual Decoration App
As one of my main projects for a course in the Iowa State University's graduate program for Human Computer Interaction in 2012, I imagined and visualized a children's game application.  In this application children chat chat online with their friends and have fun by decorating their faces with virtual accessories like hats, sunglasses, facial hair (for make-believe characters) and other accessories.  Below is a high-fidelity mock of the application's main interface.

A couple of years after this I saw the same concept of virtual accessories implemented in the Facebook mobile app, as well as other mobile apps.
